        spec_ques1 : "What is Oral Polio Vaccine?",
        spec_ans1 : "Oral poliovirus vaccines (OPV) are the predominant vaccine used in the fight to eradicate polio.  There are different types of oral poliovirus vaccine, which may contain one, a combination of two, or all three different serotypes of attenuated vaccine. Each has their own advantages and disadvantages over the others.",
        spec_ques2 : "Advantages",
        spec_ans2 : "OPVs are safe and effective and offer long lasting protection against the serotype(s) which they target. OPV stimulates good mucosal immunity, which is why it is so effective at interrupting transmission of the virus. Also OPVs are administered orally and do not require health professionals or sterile needle syringes. As such, OPVs are easy to administer in mass vaccination campaigns. For several weeks after vaccination the vaccine virus replicates in the intestine, is excreted and can be spread to others in close contact. This means that in areas with poor hygiene and sanitation, immunization with OPV can result in ‘passive’ immunization of people who have not been vaccinated.",
        spec_ques3 : "How safe is Polio Vaccine and what are its potential adverse effects?",
        spec_ans3 : "Both OPV and IPV are extremely safe. With OPV, vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) can occur in approximately 1 in 2.7 million doses. VAPP usually occurs with the first dose of OPV, and this small risk declines further with subsequent doses. On rare occasions, over time, in areas of low vaccination coverage, the live attenuated (weakened) viruses contained in OPV can begin to circulate and regain the ability to cause paralytic cases. This is known as vaccine-derived poliovirus."

        spec_ques3 : "How effective is Hep B vaccine?",
        spec_ans3 : "Hep B is one of the safest and most effective of vaccines. Studies show that it is 95% effective in preventing chronic infection. For infants exposed through the mother at birth, monovalent Hep B vaccine is 90% effective in preventing transmission if the first dose is administered within 24 hours and the series completed at the recommended intervals using the combination vaccines."

        spec_ans1 : "IPV is given by intramuscular or intradermal injection and needs to be administered by a trained health worker. IVP produces antibodies in the blood to all three types of poliovirus. In the event of infection, these antibodies prevent the spread of the virus to the central nervous system and protect against paralysis.",
        spec_ques2 : "Recommended use",
        spec_ans2 : "An increasing number of industrialized, polio-free countries are using IPV as the vaccine of choice. This is because the risk of paralytic polio associated with continued routine use of OPV is deemed greater than the risk of imported wild virus. However, as IPV does not stop transmission of the virus, OPV is used wherever a polio outbreak needs to be contained, even in countries which rely exclusively on IPV for their routine immunization programme. Once polio has been eradicated, use of all OPV will need to be stopped to prevent re-establishment of transmission due to VDPVs.",
        spec_ques3 : "How effective is the polio vaccine?",
        spec_ans3 : "IPV is also highly effective in preventing paralytic disease caused by all three types of poliovirus but induces very low levels of immunity in the intestine. As a result, when a person immunized with IPV is infected with wild poliovirus, the virus can still multiply inside the intestines and be shed in the feces, risking continued circulation."

Formerly these vaccines used to be single antigen vaccines which contained only Measles or Rubella vaccine, however it is highly recommended to use vaccines that contain both Measles and Rubella with other antigen as per the need and availability such as Measles Rubella (MR), Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) or Measles Mumps Rubella Varicella (MMRV).",
        spec_ques3 : "How effective are the MMR and MR Vaccines?",

It is essential that only the diluent made by the same manufacturer as the vaccine be used. BCG vaccine should be kept at +2°C to +8°C after reconstitution. Like other reconstituted vaccines, BCG has a short life span and, once F.1 Tuberculosis Vaccine - BCG reconstituted, must be discarded after six hours or at the end of the immunization session, whichever comes first.",
        spec_ques3 : "How safe is BCG vaccine and what are its potential adverse effects?",
        spec_ans3 : "BCG is a safe vaccine with rare adverse events. Most children do have a reaction at the site of injection. Normally, when BCG vaccine is injected, a small raised lump appears at the injection site. This usually disappears within 30 minutes. After about two weeks, a red sore forms about the size of the end of an unsharpened pencil. The sore remains for another two weeks and then heals. A small scar, about 5 mm across remains. Health workers look for this to determine whether a child has been vaccinated. However, the absence of a scar does not mean that the BCG vaccination did not work."

It does not protect against other bacteria that cause the same types of infections (pneumonia, meningitis, etc.) as pneumococcus.
